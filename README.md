# amazonTest
Using a POM design pattern I created a framework with Java 8, Selenium and TestNG

Instructions: <br />
Navigate to amazon.com.mx <br />
Search for "ipad air case" <br />
Refine search (left hand side of site) to only show 'Procase' brand cases <br />
Refine search (left hand side of site) to only show results between the price $350 to $750 <br />
Output the Name, Price and Score/Rating (Stars) of the first 5 results <br />
Assert that the first 5 results are between $350 to $750 <br />
Sort the first 5 results by price (Using Java) <br />
Sort the first 5 results by Score/Rating (Using Java) <br />
Sort the first 5 results by price (Using Java) and Assert using testng / Junit that you have sorted the items correctly <br />
Based on Score and Cost recommend the item a user should purchase <br />
