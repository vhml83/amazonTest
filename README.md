# amazonTest
Using a POM design pattern I created a framework with Java 8, Selenium and TestNG

Instructions:
Navigate to amazon.com.mx
Search for "ipad air case"
Refine search (left hand side of site) to only show 'Procase' brand cases
Refine search (left hand side of site) to only show results between the price $350 to $750
Output the Name, Price and Score/Rating (Stars) of the first 5 results
Assert that the first 5 results are between $350 to $750
Sort the first 5 results by price (Using Java)
Sort the first 5 results by Score/Rating (Using Java)
Sort the first 5 results by price (Using Java) and Assert using testng / Junit that you have sorted the items correctly.
Based on Score and Cost recommend the item a user should purchase
